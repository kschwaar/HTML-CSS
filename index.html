<div class="sectionCW"><h1>Welcome to our Homepage!</h1><p> As a well-respected Utah excavating contractor, we are called in to develop—or maintain—the infrastructure that connects the American way of life.  Southfork Field Services builds, widens and repairs roads, highways and bridges that connect cities and communities. We dig and lay miles and miles of pipeline, so people can have fresh water for their homes and businesses. We expertly break ground and prepare sites for new sports stadiums, expansions for hospitals and universities, plus many other commercial construction projects.
<br>
<br>Unlike other excavation and heavy civil construction companies, we have stayed true to our commercial excavation core and have invested in the latest GPS technology and work flow software that allows us to do our job better—and with increased efficiency. These technological capabilities, along with our high ethical business standards, have made us the excavation and construction contractor that developers and public and private companies hire.</p>

<div class="sectionCW"><h1>What is an Excavation Contractor?</h1><p>Excavation contractors are fond of telling their friends that they couldn’t bear to give up their childhood dump trucks, so they exchanged them for bigger versions. In the world of construction, excavation contractors do much more than haul dirt around; their responsibilities include site preparation, grading, trenching and many other soil-related tasks. And, yes, they do operate some very large pieces of heavy equipment.</p>
