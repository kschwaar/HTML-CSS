<p>Our Small but highly affective company prides itself on being <a href="https://youtu.be/H6wRRWi6i0c" target="_blank">safe</a>.</p>
<p>Safety and health in our company must be a part of every operation. Without question, it is every employee's responsibility at all levels.</p>

<p>We will maintain a safety and health program conforming to the best practices of organizations of this type. To be successful, such a program must embody the proper attitudes toward injury and illness prevention on the part of supervisors and employees. It also requires cooperation in all safety and health matters, not only between supervisors and employees, but also between employees and their co-workers. Only through such a cooperative effort can an effective safety and health program be established and preserved.</p>

<p>The safety and health of every employee is a high priority. Management accepts responsibility for providing a safe working environment and employees are expected to take responsibility for performing work in accordance with safe standards and practices. Safety and health will only be achieved through teamwork.  Everyone must join together in promoting safety and health and taking every reasonable measure to assure safe working conditions in the company.</p>
