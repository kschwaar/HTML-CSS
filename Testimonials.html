Once I met with them I knew this company was the best fit for my needs. Southfork's service was prompt, professional, and extremely efficient. The process was very smooth and the company was great about answering all of my questions in detail. They simply exceeded all my expectations. I would highly recommend Southfork Excavating to anyone considering a large specialty project."<br><br><em>-Kathy Hayes</em><br>St. George, UT</div>

<div class="sectionCWMain"><h1>Our Testimonials</h1><p>
"Southfork Field Services is a family-oriented business. Even more importantly, Southfork is a customer-oriented business whose employees - from the owner through all of the workers – make the customer’s desires their primary focus in every aspect of their work.<br><br>While considering the installation of a pool in our backyard, we interviewed several companies, but Southfork stood out from the rest in several areas:
<br>Careful inspection of the property with appropriate suggestions for best location taking advantage of the natural contours of the property as well as the potential views.
<br>Detailed review of the property plans, including the engineering and plumbing charts.
<br>Detailed discussions regarding County rules and regulations as well as the process for obtaining the necessary permits.
<br><br>Southfork spent hours reviewing all of the above and in working through the myriad details that need to be considered prior to any work starting. Without complaint, they also marked off the final few choices to help us visually determine what suited us best. Once our pre-construction decisions were made, Southfork provided us with Firm Fixed Price quote for the costs of the work – which was, in fact, lower than most. At that time, Southfork also gave us a firm schedule of their excavation so we could inform the other contractors exactly when they would be able to schedule their own work.
<br><br>
The company arrived on the assigned day and immediately set to work, with all of the equipment and personnel on hand from the first hour. As work progressed, they frequently talked with us and let us know exactly what was being accomplished, and what each stage of excavation was and how it would be accomplished. The work progressed quickly and neatly, with the crew cleaning as the hours went by, ensuring the property never looked as if it were being trashed by the digging.
<br><br>
Southfork finished their work ahead of schedule and completed all of their work exactly as promised. Working with them was truly a delight. My wife and I can give only our strongest recommendation as well as the highest praise for the work itself, for the integrity of the company, and for the care and conscientious ethics of the owner and his staff."<br><br><em>-Skip Family</em><br>Ogden, UT</p>
